# Spamfilter
Python Machine Learning Model API with flutter as frontend. 

Currently, SMS is one of the most important methods of communication.
However, the increasing of spam SMS causes traffic congestion, decreasing
productivity, phishing, which has become a serious problem for our society. And
the number of spam SMS is increasing every year. Therefore, spam SMS filtering
is an important, meaningful and challenging topic. The aim of this research is to
find an effective solution to filter possible spam SMS. We have developed this
software in accordance with these points so that seamless visual SMS segregation
takes place.
Spam text filter is a mobile application for detecting spam messages from your
message inbox.
Application reads all your inbox messages and checks whether message is spam
or not. Application send message body to API and API in turn returns response
whether message is spam or ham.
We have used Bayes Theorem for calculating probability. And a Naive Bayes
Classifier to develop our predicting model.
